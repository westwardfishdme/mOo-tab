  <h1>About:</h1>
  <p>This is a custom homepage that I made that allows me to create an
  efficient work flow.
  You can reuse the html to create your own homepage for chromium based browsers and such.

  <p>
  I've made this years ago, but finally published it to my github as an official project.
