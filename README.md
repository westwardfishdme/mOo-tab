# mOo-tab
A simple better new tab extension for chromium-based browsers.  Includes a built-in wiki.

# About:
This is a custom homepage that I made that allows me to create an efficient workflow. You can reuse the html to create your own homepage for chromium based browsers and such.
I've made this years ago, but finally published it to my github as an official project. It comes with a fully featured wiki that is accessible offline.

# Current Features:
- Custom keybinds.
- Customizable embedded link pages.
- A whole built-in wiki dedicated to customization, and modifying the program.

# Installation
There are 2 methods to installing this program:

- Chrome webstore
- Manual installation
Downloading through the Chrome webstore is probably the easiest method of installation-- but increases the learning curve of modifying the program.

Therefore, it is highly recommended that you install this extension manually.

# Manual Installation:
BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS PROGRAM MANUALLY, NOTE THAT YOU MUST ALSO UPDATE THE EXTENSION MANUALLY.

But you're a smart cookie, so you probably knew that already. :)

There are 4 steps to actually install this program:

Knowing your install location.

Navigating to your extensions page.

Enabling developer mode on your chromium-based browser.

Loading the unpacked extension.

All of which can be learned how to right here.

If that link for whatever reason goes down, I have included this manual for ease of access.

## Step 1: Knowing your install location.
### Windows
On Windows, your default install location SHOULD BE

`C:\Users\{username}\Downloads\custom-homepage`
### MacOS/Linux
On MacOS/Linux, your default install location SHOULD BE

`/home/{username}/Downloads/custom-homepage`
Basically, wherever you downloaded the code to, navigate there. You will need to know this for the next steps.

If it's not in any of those locations, only you and god knows where you installed this to.

## Step 2: Navigating to the Chrome extensions page.
This is a pretty easy step. Inside your browser, go to the following page:

`chrome://extensions`
This can be done by either entering that to your search bar, or by clicking on the 3 dots in the top right corner, and clicking on 'Extensions'.

## Step 3: Enabling developer mode.
Inside of `chrome://extensions`, you're going to click on the little switch in the top right that says "Developer mode".

That's it, you're in developer mode.

## Step 4: Loading the unpacked extension.
After you enable developer mode, you'll see a little bar pop-up from the top of the screen with 3 options: Load unpacked, Pack extension, and Update.

Click on Load unpacked and now navigate to the extension's directory that you found in step 1, and like that, you installed the extension.
